# PETInspector

PETInspector is a framework for evaluating Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). 

The repository contains all the code for running the evaluations of PETs. This code was used for the experimental results in the paper `Evaluating Anti-Fingerprinting Privacy Enhancing Technologies` published at WWW 2019.

## Structure

The code comprises of three main components:

1. The _fingerprinting server_, which collects fingerprints from visitors.
2. The _client simulator_, which simulates consumers and drives them to FPServer with and without various PETs. 
3. The _analysis engine_, which compares fingerprints generated by different clients to evaluate each PET.
